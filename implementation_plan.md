# Cricket Tracker Implementation Plan

This plan breaks down the build into small, trackable steps. Use the color-coded icons to track progress:
- â¬œ Not started
- ðŸŸ¨ In progress
- ðŸŸ© Done

---

## 1. Repo & Project Setup


ðŸŸ© 1.1 Initialize Git repo and directory structure  
- Create `src` directory
- Move `api`, `ml`, and `ui` into `src/`  

ðŸŸ© 1.2 Add `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt` to root  
ðŸŸ© 1.3 Set up Python environment (venv/conda)  
ðŸŸ© 1.4 Add pre-commit hooks (black, ruff, mypy)  

## 2. Infrastructure & Deployment

ðŸŸ© 2.1 Install Azure Developer CLI (AZD)  
ðŸŸ© 2.2 Run `azd init` and create `azure.yaml`  
ðŸŸ© 2.3 Scaffold Bicep templates for Container Apps, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage  
ðŸŸ© 2.4 Add Dockerfile for FastAPI + Streamlit container  
ðŸŸ© 2.5 Test local Docker build and run  
ðŸŸ© 2.6 Deploy initial app to Azure using `azd up`  


## 3. API (FastAPI)

â¬œ 3.1 Scaffold `src/api` folder and FastAPI app (`main.py`)  
â¬œ 3.2 Add JWT Auth0 middleware and RBAC decorators  
â¬œ 3.3 Create Pydantic models for all entities  
â¬œ 3.4 Implement Cosmos DB client and dependency injection  
â¬œ 3.5 Add routes for sessions, cycle logs, metrics, model registry  
â¬œ 3.6 Add endpoints for model inference and retraining  
â¬œ 3.7 Write unit tests for API endpoints  


## 4. ML Module

â¬œ 4.1 Scaffold `src/ml` folder  
â¬œ 4.2 Implement feature engineering (ACWR, aggregations)  
â¬œ 4.3 Build starter TensorFlow model (MLP)  
â¬œ 4.4 Add trainer for batch retrain from Cosmos DB  
â¬œ 4.5 Implement inference service (load/serve model, hot-reload)  
â¬œ 4.6 Integrate model registry logic  
â¬œ 4.7 Write minimal ML tests (synthetic data)  


## 5. UI (Streamlit)

ðŸŸ© 5.1 Scaffold `src/ui` folder and `dashboard.py`  
ðŸŸ© 5.3 Build player workload input form  
ðŸŸ© 5.4 Build menstrual cycle tracking form  
ðŸŸ© 5.5 Create player dashboard (charts, metrics, AI insights)  
ðŸŸ© 5.6 Build coach dashboard (team table, filters, risk badges)  
ðŸŸ© 5.7 Add player profile view (trends, cycle overlay, recommendations)  
ðŸŸ© 5.8 Add model retraining tab (button, status)  
â¬œ 5.2 Implement login screen (Auth0)  

## Remaining Screen Requirements (Post-MVP)

- Export Data: Allow coaches/admins to export player/team workload and cycle data to CSV/Excel.
- Notifications: Display alerts (e.g., "Player X is in high-risk zone this week") to coaches and players.
- Settings: Manage roles, teams, competitions, and other admin features.
- Manual Entry: Admin/coach can capture player workload details for any player.
- Enhanced Calendar: Improve menstrual cycle calendar with more detailed phase/risk overlays and export option.
- Advanced Filters: Add more filters to dashboards (date range, risk status, etc.).
- AI Insights Expansion: Show more detailed AI recommendations and risk explanations.
- Auth0 Integration: Implement login and role-based access control.

## 6. Data Model & Cosmos DB

â¬œ 6.1 Define containers: players, teams, sessions, cycleLogs, metrics, injuries, modelRegistry  
â¬œ 6.2 Implement partition keys and indexing  
â¬œ 6.3 Add data validation and privacy logic  
â¬œ 6.4 Test CRUD operations for all entities  

## 7. Security & Privacy

â¬œ 7.1 Integrate Auth0 JWT validation in API and UI  
â¬œ 7.2 Enforce RBAC on endpoints and UI screens  
â¬œ 7.3 Restrict cycle data access (player + assigned coach/medical)  
â¬œ 7.4 Add audit logging for sensitive endpoints  

## 8. CI/CD & Testing

â¬œ 8.1 Set up GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy  
â¬œ 8.2 Add test coverage for API, ML, and UI  
â¬œ 8.3 Validate deployment to Azure (Container Apps)  
â¬œ 8.4 Monitor logs and metrics (Log Analytics)  

## 9. Rollout & Validation

â¬œ 9.1 Pilot with one team (collect feedback)  
â¬œ 9.2 Refine forms, labels, and dashboards  
â¬œ 9.3 Expand to more teams  
â¬œ 9.4 Define data retention and privacy policies
